# SpeechRecon1516

This is an android application created to comunicate with a remote server to perform asynchronous speech recognition (ASR) 
using Kaldi framework (http://kaldi-asr.org/doc/).  

Here you can find only the client side. The server side is hosted at https://github.com/AndreaCarraro26/SpeechRecon1516Server/

We are Andrea Carraro, Marco Camillo and Federico Munari, all master students from University of Padua (Italy).

This project has been done as a team work for "Embedding System Programming" course held by professor Carlo Fantozzi in 2016.

We hope that all you can find here could be helpful for your purpose. There isnt't any restriction on the usage of our code. 
Unfortunatly, we'll not support the project anymore, so bugs and issues will not be corrected in the future. 

Enjoy.
